# vue-fantasy-picker


## Key Features(some still in progress)
- Import a file
- Set important columns for the file
- Set how many top players in each category to use to find the average
- Change category average method(average, median, average of a median group?)
- Calculate each players variance from category average
- Highlight top players in each category and players who are in top X players in the most categories
- Working settings tools to modify configuration
- Player filter by position
- Show the strength summary of my team or taken players(other teams)
- Player searching by partial name
- Highlight the best player and worst in each column on ranking views
- Mark your team 
- Mark players unavailable
- Local storage

## TODO:
- Fantasy team config setup(for available position slots)
- Import list of taken players(name match)
- Simpler loading of files and evaluating so its smooth process and less tedious
- Improve the performance of evaluating
- Create alternate ranking method that gives double weight to players with an above average shooting percentage so we can try that out
- Better horizontal table scrolling?
- Maybe add vue-router for better url stuff

## Phase 1
- Geared towards nba head to head fantasy team that needs to win multiple categories each week

## Phase 2
- Ability to dynamically set the players name column, scoring stats columns and the non-scoring stats columns. This can be done by clicking little icon on column title and setting option.
- More color schemes!
- Ability to draft a dream team by generating loads of teams and figuring out the best one
